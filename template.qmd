# Main Sections for Each Question {#sec-question1}

Each top-level section is named after the specific question or problem being addressed (e.g., Question ##). This ensures clarity and helps reviewers or graders quickly locate your answers.

You can input references and have them notated as well.[@john_doe2023; @jane_doe2022; @alan_smith2021]

Why use it?

-   Mimics the format of assignments where each question is treated as a standalone unit.
-   Maintains a clear link between the problem and your analysis.
-   Encourages modular thinking for multi-part assignments.

:::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
Can use the callout note boxes as a way to list the actual homework question word of word or to call out the information as important.

::: {.callout-important appearance="simple"}
You can also nest a callout box so that additional callouts can be made.

## Methodology

Purpose: Describe how you approached the problem, including any analytical tools, techniques, or frameworks you used.

Why use it?

-   Demonstrates your thought process and analytical rigor.

-   Provides enough detail for reproducibility without overwhelming with technical specific

### Data Pre-Processing

If using code boxes throughout the report vs at the bottom in one section ensure you import the proper libraries here or before.

```{r, results='hide', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, highlight=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
# Library imports
library(ggplot2)
data(mtcars)
library(stats)
library(utils)
library(reticulate) # to allow python code blocks # <1> 
```

1.  Can also use annotation not just comments

```{python, results='hide', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, highlight=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
import pandas as pd # For data handling
```

### Data Processing

## Summary

Purpose: Summarize your findings and results in a concise, narrative form.

Why use it?

-   Allows readers to grasp your key results without diving into detailed data or visuals.

-   Bridges the gap between methodology and insights.

## Key Insights

Purpose: Present the actionable insights or conclusions derived from the analysis.

Why use it?

-   Focuses on the "so what?" aspect of your work.

-   Encourages you to think critically about the implications of your results.

## Optional Code(Blocks) Section

Purpose: Include code used for analysis and visualizations.

Why use it?

-   Keeps technical implementation separate from the narrative, making the report cleaner and easier to read.

-   Ensures your work is reproducible and transparent.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, highlight=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
#| layout-ncol: 2
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Scatterplot: MPG vs. Weight")

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_bar(fill = "steelblue") +
  labs(title = "Bar Chart: Cylinder Count",
       x = "Cylinders",
       y = "Count")
```

```{python, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, highlight=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}

```

# Figures & Tables

Figures, tables, and their legends, should be included at the end of the document. Figures and tables are easily included with Quarto, e.g. @fig-galogo and @tbl-example. See the relevant Quarto documentation for [figures](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html) and [tables](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/tables.html).

# Appendix (Optional)

Purpose: Include supplementary materials like extended analyses, additional visualizations, or raw data.

Why use it?

Keeps the main report focused while providing access to detailed information if needed.
